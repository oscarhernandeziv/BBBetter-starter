This is a [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) starter kit for 2025, using [Bun](https://bun.sh), [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), and [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com). Hence, B.B.B.-etter Starter.

## Features

- Modern framework: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) and [React 19](https://react.dev)
- Ultra-fast tooling: [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Biome](https://biomejs.dev)
- Effortless authentication: [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com)
- Clean styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- And more to come!

## Notes

- Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/6593) for shadcn/ui init problems using Bun at this time. I used the workaround listed here to get it working without the "--force" flag being required. I'll remove this note once the issue is resolved.
